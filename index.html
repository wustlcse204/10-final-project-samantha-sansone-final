    <p> What Does Mercury Retrograde Mean? </p>

   <p>The term retrograde comes from the Latin word retrogradus, which literally means “backward step.”

As the name suggests, retrograde is when a planet appears to go backward in its orbit, as viewed from Earth. Astronomers refer to this as “apparent retrograde motion,” because it is an optical illusion.

The opposite of retrograde is direct or prograde motion. Prograde motion is the term astronomers prefer, while astrologers are more prone to use the term “direct” motion.
</p>

<p> Backward Motion? </p>

<p> 
    Every planet in our Solar System travels in the same direction in its journey around the Sun, and none of them ever pause and turn back in the opposite direction. Yet, all of them appear to do just that from time to time.
    
    Because of the Earth’s daily rotation, the objects in the night sky appear to “move” from east to west through the night sky. While the location of the stars relative to the Earth is fixed, at least from our vantage point, the other planets in our Solar System all orbit the Sun at varying speeds.

    The outer planets — Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune — all take longer to orbit the Sun than the Earth does, because their orbits are larger. Because of this, the Earth often laps these planets in its journey around the Sun.

When the Earth overtakes an outer planet, that planet appears to travel backward, as compared to the stars, for a time.

Picture two cars on the highway going in the same direction in different lanes. If one car is driving faster than the other, the slower car will appear to go backward from the perspective of a person in the faster car, even though the slower car is still going pretty fast in the same direction.

For the inner planets, Mercury and Venus, the mechanism that causes them to turn retrograde is the same, but in reverse. Mercury and Venus appear to go retrograde when they lap us.

Because Mercury completes its orbit around the Sun in only 88 days, the Swift Planet becomes retrograde three or four times in a calendar year, for about three weeks at a time. Outer planets have less frequent, but longer-lasting, periods of retrograde motion.

</p>

<p> Why Dread it? </p>

<p> So what does all of that have to do with people wanting to hide in their rooms for weeks at a time?

    Astrologers believe that the Moon, stars, planets, and Sun affect happenings here on Earth, and that each planet in our Solar System rules a different aspect of life.
    
    Like the Greek messenger god it was named for, Mercury is said to govern transportation and communication.
    
    Those who dread Mercury’s retrograde motion say that, when the planet travels backward, its power to positively influence these domains is stifled, leading to chaos.

Believers in the malevolent power of Mercury retrograde blame the phenomenon for everything from arguments to lost mail or luggage to automobile accidents and warn people to hold back on conducting important business during this time.

    <h1> 7 TIPS FOR SURVIVING AND THRIVING DURING MERCURY RETROGRADE BY LISA LEVINE </h1>

    <ul>
    <h3><li>Surrender to the Slowdowns</li>  </h3>
    <p id="tip1"> Don’t fight them but instead, try to take a moment of gratitude for anything that slows us down a little. We live in a high-paced society; it’s good to take a moment. In the developed world, we spend very little time waiting for anything. You can give some gratitude for the high-speed internet that usually works perfectly during this time. </p>

    <h3><li>Clean Out Your Closets </li></h3>
    <p id="tip2"> This is my all-time favorite Mercury retrograde project. It’s a great time to deal with unfinished business, this can be on the physical level: the piles of clothes that need to go the Goodwill or the stacks of papers on your desk that need to be filed—take this time to clean up and get organized. Mercury rules Virgo, the great organizer of the zodiac, so doing a “pre-fall cleaning” is a perfect way to get things in order before the season actually begins.</p>

    <h3> <li>Finish Projects </li></h3>
    <p id="tip3"> This time period is not great for starting projects but rather for completing them. Projects you started but got placed on the back burner—now is the time to tie them up. </p>

    <h3> <li>Reach Out to People You Haven't Seen but are Thinking Of </li></h3>
    <p id="tip4"> This may happen on its own. I always notice my inbox filled with emails from people I haven’t heard from in some time. If people come into your consciousness, reach out. Just like those projects you need to finish, this is the time to rekindle those relationships you might’ve lost touch with that you care for.</p>

    <h3> <li>Don't Sign Contracts or Break Up with Your Partner </li></h3>
    <p id="tip5"> It’s a more traditional superstition that it’s not a good time to sign contracts or buy electronics as they are more likely to break. If you break up with your beloved, you may find yourself back together again. Things that happen during Mercury retrograde just don’t always stick. On the other hand you may find yourself back together with an ex in this period… unfinished business!</p>

    <h3> <li>Triple-Check All of Your Emails and Text Messages </li></h3>
    <p id="tip6"> The typos will triple, and what is being said can be misconstrued. If you notice communications getting a little wonky via text or email, it might be better to call and discuss things rather than have misunderstandings.</p>

    <h3><li>Be Extra Gentle with Yourself and Your Loved Ones-Basically Everyone</li></h3>
    <p id="tip7"> Not only is it Mercury retrograde right now but eclipse season as well, so we are being pushed in many ways. Be gentle, up your self-care and know that everyone around you is in the pressure cooker, too, so be gentle with them also. We’re being asked to grow and forced out of our comfort zones so breathe, surrender and make graceful steps forward.</p>
